Getting And Cleaning Data:  CourseProject
===================================

Introduction :

This repository contains the code I have written to perform the specified analysis task on the UCI HAR Dataset for the course project for the coursera course - Getting and Cleaning Data. 

About Raw Data : 

The raw data contains both test and training data set from the experiment carried out on 30 subjects for various activities like Walking , Standing etc wearing smartphone and measurements for acceleration etc are catprued. 

About the code :

The R script reads and extracts test and training data set. It combines them into a single data set and extracts only mean and std measurements for all subjects and activities. The tidy data set contains aggregated value for the mean and std measurements for all subjects and activities and is written to disk.

The tidy data set can be viewed in excel by modifying the extention to csv(as it is created using ',' as seperator for enabling easy readability)

About the codebook:

Codebook explains the steps performed and the resulting data.
